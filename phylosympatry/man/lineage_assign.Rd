\title{Assign Lineages based on proportional membership to categories}
\usage{
lineage_assign(lineages, species_prop, cutoff_1, cutoff_2, cutoff_3,
  cutoff_4)
}
\arguments{
\item{lineages}{output from \code{\link{get_lineages}}}

\item{species_prop}{vector of the proportions of the range that is in species-rich areas for each species, in the order of lineages$species}

\item{cutoff_1}{fraction of the range in species-rich areas that qualifies a species as rich-associated.}

\item{cutoff_2}{fraction of rich-associated species that qualifies a lineage as rich-associated}

\item{cutoff_3}{fraction of the range in species-poor areas that qualifies a species as poor-associated}

\item{cutoff_4}{fraction of species-poor associated species that qualifies a lineage as poor-associated.}
